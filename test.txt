 and well integrate web sites, python is popular based on the ease to learn and
 advance integrate tools to build software like the most popular AI.

2:How do you write a comment in Python? Why are comments important?
ans: A comment in Python begins with # symbol and """
Comment is important because it makes code easier to understand and helps in debugging

3: What is the difference between print() and input() and give th example.
ans: print() displayes the data to the screen 
print("hello world")
input() collect data to be used
input("please enter you name: ")

4:How do you declare and initialize variables in python?
 variables in python are declare by assigning a value using the = operator
x = 10

5:What are the basic data types in Python? Provide examples for int, float, string and boolean
ans: int (int(10))
string = "this is a string"
float = 3.24
boolean = is_active

6:What is the difference between a list and a tuple in python?
ans: list is a mutable and can be modified , []
while tuple is immutable and cannot be modified, ()

7:What are conditional statements in python? write a program to check if a number is positive and negative, or zero?
ans: conditional statements in python execute specific blocks of code based on the condition
num = int(input("enter a number: "))
if num > 0:
    print("the number is positive")
elif num < 0:
    print("the number is negative: ")
else:
    print("the number is zero: ")

8:Explain the concept of loops in Python. What is the difference between a for loop and a while loop?
ans:  loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly.
for loop: iterates over a sequence
while loop: repeats as long as a condition is true.

9. How do you write a function in Python? Write a simple function to calculate the square of a number.
ans: A function is defined using the def keyword.

Example:


def square(num):
    return num ** 2

print(square(5))  # Output: 25


10. What is the purpose of the len() function in Python? Demonstrate it by finding the length of a string.
ans: The len() function returns the number of items in a sequence (e.g., string, list).

Example:
my_string = "Hello, World!"
print(len(my_string))  # Output: 13


11:What is Python, and why is it popular?
ans:Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability.

Why it is popular:

Easy to learn and use.
Extensive libraries and frameworks.
Cross-platform compatibility.
Wide applications e.g., web development, AI, data science.
Strong community support.


12:What are the basic rules for naming variables in Python?
ans:Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore (_).
Subsequent characters can include letters, numbers, or underscores.
Variable names are case-sensitive.
Reserved keywords cannot be used as variable names.
Examples:
Valid: name, _value, age1
Invalid: 1age, name#, class


13:What is the difference between dynamically typed and statically typed languages? Which type is Python?
ans: Dynamically typed: Variables do not need explicit type declarations. Types are determined at runtime. (e.g., Python)
Statically typed: Variable types must be declared explicitly before use. (e.g., Java, C++)
Python is dynamically typed.

Example in Python:

x = 5       # x is an integer
x = "Hello" # x is now a string

How do you display a message on the screen using Python? Provide an example.
ans:Use the print() function to display messages.

Example:

print("Hello, World!")  # Output: Hello, World!


14:What are the basic data types in Python? Provide examples of int, float, string, and boolean.
ans:int: Whole numbers. Example: x = 42
float: Decimal numbers. Example: y = 3.14
string: Text. Example: name = "Alice"
boolean: True/False values. Example: is_active = True
Examples:

x = 10       # int
y = 3.14     # float
name = "Bob" # string
is_active = False # boolean


15:What is the difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python? Give examples.
ans:Mutable: Can be changed after creation. (e.g., lists, dictionaries)
Immutable: Cannot be changed after creation. (e.g., strings, tuples)
Examples:

# Mutable
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list[0] = 10  # Allowed

# Immutable
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
# my_tuple[0] = 10  # Error: Cannot modify a tuple


16:How do you perform type conversion in Python? Convert a string to an integer with an example.
ans:Use built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.

Example:

num_str = "123"
num_int = int(num_str)  # Converts string to integer
print(num_int)  # Output: 123


17:What are conditional statements in Python? Write a program to check if a number is even or odd.
ans:Conditional statements allow decision-making in code using if, elif, and else.

Example Program:

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if num % 2 == 0:
    print("Even")
else:
    print("Odd")


18:Explain the difference between if, elif, and else in Python.
ans: if: Evaluates the first condition.
elif: Adds more conditions if the previous if or elif is false.
else: Executes if none of the conditions are true.
Example:

x = 5
if x > 10:
    print("Greater than 10")
elif x == 5:
    print("Equal to 5")
else:
    print("Less than 5")


19:Write a program to find the largest of three numbers using if-else statements.
ans: a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))
c = int(input("Enter third number: "))

if a > b and a > c:
    print("Largest is", a)
elif b > c:
    print("Largest is", b)
else:
    print("Largest is", c)


20:What are loops in Python? What is the difference between a for loop and a while loop?
ans: Loops are used to repeat a block of code.

For loop: Iterates over a sequence.
While loop: Repeats as long as a condition is true.
Examples:

# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# While loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1


21:Write a program to print the first 10 numbers of a multiplication table for a given number.

ans: num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(f"{num} x {i} = {num * i}")


22:What is the purpose of the break and continue statements in loops? Provide examples.

ans: break: Exits the loop prematurely.
continue: Skips the current iteration and continues to the next.
Examples:


# Break example
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)

# Continue example
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)


23:Write a program to calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 using a for loop.

ans: total = 0
for i in range(1, 101):
    total += i
print("Sum:", total)


24:What is a function in Python, and why is it used?

ans: A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions help improve modularity and code reuse.

Example:

def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

25:Write a function to calculate the area of a rectangle.

ans: def rectangle_area(length, width):
    return length * width

print(rectangle_area(5, 3))  # Output: 15


26:What are default arguments in Python functions? Provide an example.
ans:Default arguments are parameters with default values.

Example:

def greet(name="Guest"):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet()          # Output: Hello, Guest!
greet("Alice")   # Output: Hello, Alice!


27:What is the difference between a list, tuple, and set in Python?
ans: List: Mutable, allows duplicates.
Tuple: Immutable, allows duplicates.
Set: Mutable, no duplicates.
Example:

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
my_set = {1, 2, 2, 3}  # Output: {1, 2, 3}


28:How do you add and remove elements in a list? Provide examples using append(), insert(), and remove().

my_list = [1, 2, 3]

my_list.append(4)     # Add to the end
my_list.insert(1, 10) # Add at index 1
my_list.remove(2)     # Remove the first occurrence of 2

print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 10, 3, 4]


29:What is a dictionary in Python? Create a dictionary to store information about a student and retrieve values by keys.
ans: A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs.

Example:

student = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 21,
    "major": "Computer Science"
}

print(student["name"])  # Output: John
print(student["age"])   # Output: 21
